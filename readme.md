# Easy Post Note - *WP Plugin*
-----------
This plugin lets you easily attach notes to posts. Handy if you're doing big site changes, or are multi author and want to add review notes.

I specifically made it for my site a while back while doing a major upgrade. Might be useful to others.

You can download the plugin from the [WordPress Plugin Repository Page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-post-note/)
